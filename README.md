Documentation: Social Network Analysis Application

Introduction

The Social Network Analysis Application is a Java console program for analyzing social networks. It represents users as nodes and their relationships (friendships or follows) as edges.

Features

1.	Add Users - Add new users (nodes) to the network.
2.	Add Connections - Create a connection (edge) between two existing users.
3.	Identify Influential Users - Analyze the network to find users with the most connections.
4.	Display Network - View all users and their connections.
5.	Exit  - Close the application.
   
Why Did I Make This Application?

I created this application to demonstrate how graph structures can be used to analyze social networks, specifically identifying influential users and their connections. It helps understand network dynamics and is a practical example of using graphs in real-world scenarios.

How Does It Contribute?

To Me: Improves skills in Java, graph algorithms, and problem-solving.
To the Community: Educational tool for learning graph-based analysis..Can be used by small groups or organizations to identify key influencers and understand network dynamics.
